# Sandlot Picks Analytics

## 🧠 Overview

**Sandlot Picks Analytics** is a data-driven baseball analytics platform powered by machine learning.  
This web application provides an overview of the **Sandlot Picks API**, a predictive engine built to forecast baseball player performance metrics — specifically **batter** and **pitcher props**.

By leveraging historical data, rolling metrics, and advanced ML algorithms, the system delivers insights to help identify edges in player matchups and betting markets.

The frontend React application serves as a modern, responsive website introducing users to the Sandlot Picks Analytics product, its features, and use cases.

- **Hits** – Forecasts the number of hits a batter will achieve.  
- **Home Runs** – Calculates the likelihood of a batter hitting a home run.

#### ⚾ Pitcher Props
- **Strikeouts** – Predicts the total strikeouts for a pitcher in a given game.  
- **Earned Runs** – Estimates how many earned runs a pitcher is likely to allow.  
- **Pitcher Outs** – Projects the number of outs a pitcher will record.  
- **Opponent Stats Integration** – Incorporates advanced opponent data such as:
