Teams now make decisions based not only on scouting reports and player chemistry, but also on sophisticated algorithms and performance models. The spark of intuition hasn't disappeared—but it’s now checked against the data before decisions are made."

The turning point came in the early 2000s with the Oakland Athletics and their pioneering use of analytics—popularized in Michael Lewis’ Moneyball. Faced with one of the smallest payrolls in the league, the A’s front office, led by GM Billy Beane, used advanced metrics to identify undervalued players who could contribute in big ways."
