It’s hard to argue against Vogt’s résumé: overcoming a 15.5-game deficit, losing several key players, surviving the chaos of losing his All-Star closer to a gambling scandal, and still storming back with a 10-game winning streak to claim the AL Central crown. It was a remarkable story — one of perseverance, culture, and grit."

From a predictive modeling or betting perspective, it’s a case study in not overreacting to a single down year. The underlying data—exit velocities, defensive metrics, and bullpen FIP—all hinted that the Blue Jays were better than their 2024 record suggested. By tweaking their offensive approach and tightening up defensively, they unlocked the potential that analytics already saw under the surface."

Additional names like INF Ty France, RHP Seranthony Domínguez, and INF Isiah Kiner-Falefa also hit the market, raising questions about how much of this core the Jays can realistically retain."
