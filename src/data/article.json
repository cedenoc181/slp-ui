And the top-end thump is real: Soto (.921 OPS, 43 HR), Caminero (.846 OPS, 45 HR), Ramírez (.863 OPS, 30 HR), and Marte (.893 OPS, 28 HR) headline a unit that averaged ~.836 OPS across the nine.

Options like Manny Machado, Rafael Devers, O’Neil Cruz, Elly De La Cruz, and Geraldo Perdomo give the DR matchup nukes and positional flexibility. Need late-inning thump versus a righty? Devers changes the inning with one swing. Want length at short or a left-side cannon? O’Neil Cruz brings elite arm strength and light-tower power. Prefer speed/chaos? Elly De La Cruz can flip an inning with a steal or a missile to the gap. Perdomo offers glove-first stability and OBP to reset the top. And Machado remains a bankable at-bat with postseason-grade poise. In a compressed tournament, this depth wins days when one or two stars don’t have it."

That’s why, on paper, we have Team DR atop Pool D—and we expect them to make a legitimate run for Gold."

Corner sluggers tend to dominate rate and counting stats. Catchers spread value across framing, blocking, controlling the run game, shepherding pitching plans, and still need to hit enough to matter. On paper, Judge’s line makes the case in seconds. On the field, Raleigh’s value accumulates in inches: a smothered splitter here, a borderline strike there, a mound visit that changes a sequence."

His ability to damage mistakes and punish quality pitches alike likely drove the margin. \n• **Leverage:** Middle-of-the-order bats are judged (no pun intended) on how often they tilt games late. Judge’s line supports that narrative. \n• **Positional Scarcity & Durability:** Raleigh’s 60 HR from the catcher spot is historic-tier thunder. Add the physical tax of catching and you have an argument that his offense should be graded on a curve — which many critics felt voters didn’t fully apply. \n• **Run Prevention:** The zero passed balls milestone is more than neat — it’s strategic freedom for an entire pitching staff. That’s value, even if it’s not as visible as a three-run blast."

When a hitter posts both a top-shelf batting average and apex power with elite on-base and slugging, he doesn’t just lead; he separates. Even a historically clean defensive season from a catcher — paired with 60 homers! — can struggle to overcome a line as complete and efficient as Judge’s from April to September."

Zero passed balls for a qualified catcher should sit alongside 60 HR in the season’s headline. Pitchers expanding the zone in the dirt because they trust their backstop should be discussed with the same reverence as a 450-foot blast. The sport is getting better at quantifying framing, blocking, pop times, and sequencing value; the next step is letting those numbers speak as loudly as OPS in awards season."
