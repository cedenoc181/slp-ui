That’s a 60-homer catcher anchoring an offense from a position that demands daily physical and mental strain. Offensive catchers usually trade bat for bruises; Raleigh refused the bargain."

It reflects elite receiving, game-calling, and focus across thousands of high-stress pitches. For pitchers, that kind of certainty alters pitch selection, unlocks breaking balls in the dirt, and lengthens at-bats in ways that never show up as gaudy counting stats."

          "text": "MVP voting has always wrestled with the same question: how do you compare a hitter’s raw production to a catcher’s quieter — but constant — influence on run prevention? Corner sluggers tend to dominate rate and counting stats. Catchers spread value across framing, blocking, controlling the run game, shepherding pitching plans, and still need to hit enough to matter. On paper, Judge’s line makes the case in seconds. On the field, Raleigh’s value accumulates in inches: a smothered splitter here, a borderline strike there, a mound visit that changes a sequence."

His ability to damage mistakes and punish quality pitches alike likely drove the margin. \n• **Leverage:** Middle-of-the-order bats are judged (no pun intended) on how often they tilt games late. Judge’s line supports that narrative. \n• **Positional Scarcity & Durability:** Raleigh’s 60 HR from the catcher spot is historic-tier thunder. Add the physical tax of catching and you have an argument that his offense should be graded on a curve — which many critics felt voters didn’t fully apply. \n• **Run Prevention:** The zero passed balls milestone is more than neat — it’s strategic freedom for an entire pitching staff. That’s value, even if it’s not as visible as a three-run blast."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The simplest answer: Judge’s bat cleared a bar that almost forces a voter’s hand. When a hitter posts both a top-shelf batting average and apex power with elite on-base and slugging, he doesn’t just lead; he separates. Even a historically clean defensive season from a catcher — paired with 60 homers! — can struggle to overcome a line as complete and efficient as Judge’s from April to September."

In a most-valuable conversation that often defaults to run creation in a tie, Judge’s bat provided the final nudge."

          "text": "The takeaway shouldn’t be that defense doesn’t matter — it’s that our shared vocabulary for catcher value still lags. Zero passed balls for a qualified catcher should sit alongside 60 HR in the season’s headline. Pitchers expanding the zone in the dirt because they trust their backstop should be discussed with the same reverence as a 450-foot blast. The sport is getting better at quantifying framing, blocking, pop times, and sequencing value; the next step is letting those numbers speak as loudly as OPS in awards season."
